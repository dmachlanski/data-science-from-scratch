# Data Science from Scratch playground
My notes and code samples from the ["Data Science from Scratch"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X) book written by Joel Grus.

I'm not aiming to include all of the book's code samples but rather to highlight the aspects that seem interesting and worth mentioning to me. My main outcomes.
